# üß† Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection in Children Using Machine Learning

## üîç Overview

This project is part of a broader research initiative focused on the early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in children aged two years and below, using eye-tracking data and machine learning. Conducted during my internship at **Polytech Tours, Universit√© de Tours, France**, my primary contributions were centered on building the data processing pipeline and developing initial machine learning models. This work laid the foundation for later deep learning-based classification systems.

The objective was to minimize reliance on traditional clinical diagnostics by identifying visual attention markers through AI-driven pattern recognition.

## üë®‚Äçüíª My Contributions

### 1. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
- Processed and standardized over **4,000 multi-sheet eye-tracking records** from pediatric subjects.
- Performed extensive data cleaning:
  - Removed duplicate entries and irrelevant sheets.
  - Addressed missing values by marking "no data" instances.
  - Parsed metadata fields (e.g., filename, patient ID, look zones).
- Consolidated all patient data into a single, structured dataset suitable for ML workflows.

### 2. Heatmap Generation
- Transformed gaze coordinate data into **1024√ó768 resolution heatmaps** to visually represent attention density.
- Enhanced spatial visibility using **7√ó7 Gaussian filtering**.
- Organized output by image ID and classification label to support supervised model training.

### 3. Initial Model Prototyping
- Built and evaluated baseline **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** classifiers using the generated heatmaps.
- Achieved ~70% accuracy on preliminary CNN trials, confirming the effectiveness of the data pipeline.
